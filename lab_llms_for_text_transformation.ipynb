It's not just for kids - even adults can appreciate the charm of pandas. The plush is incredibly soft and cute, and my daughter carries it everywhere with her. However, I did notice that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems like a manufacturing flaw rather than intentional design. Despite its minor imperfections, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected given the price. I believe there are larger options available for the same cost. On the bright side, the delivery was prompt, arriving a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy playing with it myself before gifting it to my daughter. This panda plush is a delightful addition to any collection, perfect for both children and adults who appreciate quality and cuteness in their stuffed animals."
